                address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that transmission was successful. The

                not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of the buffer 
                should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockSent"can be used to detect the 
                end of the transmission. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - CI2C1_MasterReceiveBlock -This method writes one (7-bit addressing) or two (10-bit addressing) slave address bytes

                address must be specified before, by the "SelectSlaveDevice" method or in component initialization section, 
                "Target slave address init" property. If the method returns ERR_OK, it doesn't mean that reception was 
                successful. The state of reception is detectable by means of events (OnMasterSendComplete  or OnError). Data to 
                be received are not copied to an internal buffer and remains in the original location. Therefore the content of 
                the buffer should not be changed until the transmission is complete. Event "OnMasterBlockReceived"can be used 
                to detect the end of the reception. This method is available only for the MASTER or MASTER - SLAVE mode.
   - CI2C1_SelectSlaveDevice -This method selects a new slave for communication by its 7-bit slave, 10-bit address or general 
                call value. Any send or receive method directs to or from selected device, until a new slave device is selected

                preferred method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and 
                <OnBreak> the return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the

                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.

                length of the input buffer is defined and the receiver property is enabled.  If less than requested number of 
                characters is received only the available data is copied from the receive buffer to the user specified 
                destination. The value ERR_EXEMPTY is returned and the value of variable pointed by the Rcv parameter is set to 
                the number of received characters.
   - AS_BLE_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the 
                output buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.

                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - AS_BLE_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.

                transmitter property is enabled.
